            <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
            <p>
                I started my first coffee shop in 2004 in
                Hampstead Garden Suburbs after deciding to give
                up my 9 to 5 job in the city. With no catering
                experience, the only way I knew how to operate a
                business was NOT to look at it as a business. I
                treated it like my home and all the customers were
                guests in my home.</p>
            <p> After 13 years, I still stand by the same principle
                as I have not yet learnt the art of the business but
                have mastered the art of being a host. We buy the best
                fresh ingredients and cook the food I serve to my family
                at home. Everything is freshly cooked on site and served
                immediately to our guests.
            </p>
